# 🚢 Helm – Kubernetes Package Manager

## 📌 Introduction

Helm is a **package manager for Kubernetes**.  
Just like **apt** is used to install software on Linux and **npm** is used for Node.js, **Helm is used to install, upgrade, and manage applications on Kubernetes**.

A Helm package is called a **Chart**.  
A chart contains everything needed to run an application on Kubernetes:
- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Ingress
- Values (configuration)

Helm helps us deploy **complex Kubernetes applications using a single command**.


## ❓ Why Do We Need Helm?

Managing Kubernetes applications using plain YAML files becomes difficult when:

- The application has **many YAML files**
- Configuration changes for **dev, QA, prod**
- Repeated deployments
- Rollbacks are needed
- Versioning of applications is required

### Problems Without Helm 😓
- Too many YAML files to manage
- Manual edits for each environment
- No easy rollback
- Hard to reuse templates

### Benefits of Helm ✅
- Reusable templates
- Environment-specific configurations
- Easy upgrades & rollbacks
- Version control for deployments
- One command deployment

## 🧠 Simple Analogy (Easy to Remember)

### 🍕 Pizza Analogy

Think of **Kubernetes YAML files** as:
- Dough (Deployment)
- Cheese (Service)
- Toppings (ConfigMap, Secret, Ingress)

Without Helm:
👉 You prepare everything **manually every time**

With Helm:
👉 You have a **recipe (Helm Chart)**  
👉 You just say:

## 📦 Helm Core Concepts Explained

Helm works using a few key building blocks. Understanding these makes Helm very easy.

### 📊 What is a Chart in Helm?

A Helm Chart is a package of Kubernetes resources.

Think of a chart as a complete application definition that includes:

- Deployments
- Services
- ConfigMaps
- Secrets
- Ingress
- Configuration values

In simple words:
- Chart = Application package

### 🌐 What is a Helm Repository?

A Helm Repository is a storage location for Helm charts. It works exactly like:

- apt repo for Linux
- npm registry for Node.js
- docker hub for Docker images

In simple words:
- Repository = Chart store

### 🧩 What are Templates in Helm?

Templates are Kubernetes YAML files with placeholders. Helm uses Go templating to dynamically generate YAML based on values.

In simple words:

- Templates = Reusable Kubernetes YAML

### 🧾 What is values.yaml in Helm?

values.yaml is the configuration file for a Helm chart. It contains values that are injected into templates, such as:

- Image name & tag
- Number of replicas
- Service type
- Ports
- Environment variables

In simple words:
- values.yaml = Configuration file

| Validate Chart      | `helm lint`              | `helm lint ./dinner-app`                                       | Validates chart syntax and best practices         |
| Render Templates    | `helm template`          | `helm template dinner-release ./dinner-app`                    | Displays Kubernetes manifests without installing  |

| Install (Dry Run)   | `helm install --dry-run` | `helm install dinner-release ./dinner-app --dry-run`           | Simulates installation without creating resources |
| Install with Values | `helm install -f`        | `helm install dinner-release ./dinner-app -f values.yaml`      | Installs chart using a custom values file         |
| List Releases       | `helm list`              | `helm list`                                                    | Lists all Helm releases in current namespace      |
